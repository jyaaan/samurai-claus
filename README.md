Secret Santa for Yamashiros starting 2023

Samurai Claus is an interactive Secret Santa app powered by OpenAI. It effortlessly sends reminders and facilitates anonymous communication between gift givers and recipients via SMS. It tracks addresses, manages wishlists, and even comes up with gift suggestions—all in the style of a campy Santa character called “Samurai Claus,” which might fit our Japanese-American family.

	•	Automatic Matching: Samurai Claus automatically pairs Secret Santas with their santees. Just provide the names and mobile numbers, and let the app handle the rest.
	•	Smart Database Management: Framework to read and write to the database allows Samurai Claus to remember important details like wishlists and home addresses. Easily add new CRUD abilities and conversation topics!
	•	Samurai Optional: Customize the app’s personality by modifying prompt templates.
